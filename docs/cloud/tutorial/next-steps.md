# Next Steps

So far we've run a Flow locally a variety of ways and moved up to distributing the Flow execution with Kubernetes. This is just the beginning because Prefect Cloud has many more features to explore!

## Concepts

Visit the [Cloud Concept](/cloud/concepts/api.html) docs for actions such as working directly with Prefect Cloud's [GraphQL API](/cloud/concepts/graphql.html), diving into the [CLI](/cloud/concepts/cli.html), setting [concurrency limits](/cloud/concepts/concurrency-limiting.html) on your runs, and more.

## Agents

To learn more about Prefect Agents, [Flow affinity](/cloud/agents/overview.html#flow-affinity-labels) via labels, or find information on platform specific Agents visit the [Agent](/cloud/agents/overview.html) documentation.

## Storage Options

Store your Flows in the cloud using Azure, GCS, or S3! For more information visit the [Storage Options](/cloud/execution/storage_options.html) documentation.

## Execution Environments

For information related to Execution Environments take a look at the [Cloud Execution](/cloud/execution/overview.html) documentation.

## Deployment Recipes

Check out some of the [Deployment Recipes](/cloud/recipes/configuring_storage.html) that are written below for some helpful Flow deployment patterns.
