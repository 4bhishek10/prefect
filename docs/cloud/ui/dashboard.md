# Dashboard

## Overview

The Cloud dashboard provides an overview of all of your team's flows. It was designed around a simple question:

> What's the health of my system?

To answer this question, the dashboard surfaces many insights, including summaries of recent runs, links to error logs, descriptions of upcoming runs (including warnings for late runs), an activity timeline, and agent monitoring.

The dashboard may be filtered by [project](/cloud/concepts/projects) and also period, starting with the last 24 hours.

## Agents

The Agents page shows any [Prefect Agents](/cloud/agents/overview) that have recently interacted with your Prefect Cloud instance. Agents are considered "healthy" if they have interacted with Cloud in the last minute (typically, agents ping every 10 seconds), and "unhealthy" after a few minutes have gone by.
